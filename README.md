This is a little program to fetch data from AO3 and perform math with the data so users can find out how many millions of words of fanfiction they have read, and the like.

I will properly write this README at a later date when the project has more meat and I am more familioar with python jargon.

For now I need to say all code in the ao3api directory was written by [alexwlchan](https://github.com/alexwlchan) and their full api code can be found [here](https://github.com/alexwlchan/ao3). I wanted to make edits and add functionality but the code is unmaintained. I will try to notate everywhere I have added my own code.

Alexwlchan thank you!! I now have the goal of writing my own AO3 API one day. Hopefully soon :3

I want to make a little note for myself that when I write my own API I'd like to decouple the HTML parsing and the I/O logic similar to how alexwlchan stated in their own README notes.
